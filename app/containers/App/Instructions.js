    <h2>About HCW Grabhub</h2>
    <p>
      Grabhub was generated using{' '}
      <a href="https://www.reactboilerplate.com/" target="_blank">
        React Boilerplate
      </a>
      , a boilerplate application developed by Max Stoiber for building scalable
      React Web applications. Please get started by familiarizing yourself with
      the project if you are not already. The boilerplate ships with an example
      app, an interface for fetching links to a Github user&#39;s repos.
      Normally when you use React Boilerplate, You remove the sample app by
      running <code>npm run clean</code> before beginning development. For
      Grabhub, we have kept the sample app and would like you to add another
      feature.
    </p>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <h3>The client has requested a new feature...</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <em>
        As a person, when I visit the home page, I see a field to enter a Github
        username. When I enter a username and hit enter, add a link to a user
        detail page above the list of repos that returns as a search result.
        This link would take the person to a new page that provides the
        following information: the user&#39;s name, avatar image, a link to
        their github profile, when they joined the system, and a list of their
        followers.
      </em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Follow the established pattern to add the new feature. Maintain the 100%
      test coverage established in the repo.
